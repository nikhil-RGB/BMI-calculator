## Description

P.s: Please view this README on a computer or tablet rather than a mobile phone screen.

This is a basic flutter app for calculating an individual's **BMI(Body Mass Index).**

**BMI**, or **Body Mass Index**, is a measure of body fat based on a person's weight and height. It is commonly used as a screening tool to assess whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.

The formula for calculating BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ```(BMI = kg/mÂ²)```. For example, if a person weighs ```70``` kilograms and is ```1.75``` meters tall, their BMI would be ```70 / (1.75^2) = 22.86.```

The following are the general BMI categories:

- Underweight: BMI below ```18.5```
- Normal weight: BMI between ```18.5``` and ```24.9```
- Overweight: BMI between ```25``` and ```29.9```
- Obese: BMI ```30``` or higher

> **Note**
> It is important to note that BMI is not a perfect measure of body fat as it does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, or the distribution of fat throughout > the body. Additionally, BMI is not always accurate for certain populations such as athletes, older adults, or people with a lot of muscle mass. Therefore, it should be > used in conjunction with other measures such as waist circumference and body composition analysis.


The app consists of a welcome screen, an input screen where the user can input their weight(kilograms/pounds) and height(centimeters/inches) and finally, a result screen where their BMI number and category will displayed.
I worked on this project as a part of the Google Development Student Community SRM(GDSC SRM) technical recruitment process, and would like to thank them for this oppurtunity.

### Installing
